# Piotroski-F-Score
Determining the best-performing stocks using Piotroski F-Score 
Piotroski F-Score Rank model provides investors a ranked list of companies from top to bottom based on their performance in the current and last year. The important advantage of this method is that there is no need to have a lot of data from the company (like startups). In this method, we need only to have current and last yearâ€™s data (or quarters) to calculate the differences in the variables.
To calculate measurements of Piotroski-F-Score, first, we need to pull out these variables from balance sheets and then put them into formulas.

Variables:
Net income, Total Assets at the beginning of the year, Cash flow from operation, total long-term debt, current assets, current Liabilities, issued common stock, profit, and sales.

The output of the code is a table that shows the ranked list of companies based on their performance means that the first rank is the best-performing company.
